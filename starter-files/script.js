 *  STEPS:
 *
 *  1. Declare a class to GET weather data, and GET the woeid, output received data
 *  2. Register an event listener and attach it to the GET requests chain from above, adjust UI loading state
 *  3. Prepare data for the UI in advance and try to use unified structure before outputting to the template
 *  4. Divide classes per function to have a more clean code approach and separation on concerns
 *  5. Add error/loading states and cover edge use cases
